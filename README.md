Jupyter notebook file and readme for the completion of Module 5's challenge (homework)

For the most part, the written Python codes were derived from curriculum content, via instruction and/or in-class activities, but there were some sources consulted for completing the challenge (all are also mentioned/cited within the code).

For in-depth rationale for specific code/lines of code, please see the code file because it contains comments throughout.
